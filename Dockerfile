# Create the second stage with the most basic that we need - a

# etc. When we do this we'll end up dropping any previous
# stages (defined as `FROM <some_image> as <some_name>`)
# allowing us to start with a fat build image and end up with
# a very small runtime image. Another common option is using
# `alpine` so that the end image also has a package manager.
